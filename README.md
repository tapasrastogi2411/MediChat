## Deployed Site

## Tech Stack
- Made using NextJS 14.2.1 and Javascript
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the database to store the text messages
- Tailwind CSS to style the UI

## Features

- One can either post a text message or upload an image
- Messages persist even after refreshing the page
